## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Language**: C11 for UEFI code, Rust (stable) for scanner/adversary binaries, Python 3.10+ for tooling, Bash for scripts
- **Style**: Follow EDK II coding style for UEFI code
- **Comments**: Clear, concise, and explain *why*, not just *what*
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with any changes

### UEFI Code Standards

```c
// Use EDK II types
EFI_STATUS
EFIAPI
MyFunction (
  IN  EFI_HANDLE        ImageHandle,
  IN  EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE  *SystemTable
  )
{
  // Function implementation
  return EFI_SUCCESS;
}
```

### Python Code Standards

```python
# Follow PEP 8
# Use type hints
# Include docstrings

def my_function(param: str) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description.
    
    Args:
        param: Parameter description
        
    Returns:
        Return value description
    """
    return True
```

### Bash Script Standards

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script description
# Usage: script.sh [OPTIONS]

set -euo pipefail  # Strict error handling

# Use functions
my_function() {
    local param="$1"
    # Implementation
}
```

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `security`: Security-related changes

**Example:**
```
feat(BootkitPkg): Add PCR validation to DXE hook

Implement TPM PCR validation in the DXE injection module to
ensure attestation data integrity. This enhances the defensive
telemetry capabilities.

Refs: #42
```

### Commit Signing (REQUIRED)

All commits MUST be GPG-signed:

```bash
# Configure GPG signing
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Sign commits
git commit -S -m "Your message"
```

## Testing Requirements

### Required Tests

All contributions must include:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual functions/modules
2. **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
3. **Safety Tests**: Verify kill-switches remain functional
4. **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing functionality preserved

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
./scripts/run-tests.sh --suite safety

# Run with coverage
./scripts/run-tests.sh --coverage
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for security-critical paths
- All kill-switch mechanisms must have tests

## Documentation Requirements

### Required Documentation Updates

When contributing, update:

1. **Code Comments**: Inline documentation
2. **API Documentation**: For public interfaces
3. **User Documentation**: If user-facing changes
4. **Technical Docs**: For architectural changes
5. **CHANGELOG.md**: Summary of changes

### Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep language clear and concise
- Update diagrams if architecture changes

## Security Considerations
