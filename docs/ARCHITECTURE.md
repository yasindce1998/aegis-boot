## 3. Emulation Module: UEFI Hooking Mechanisms

### 3.1 DXE Phase Implantation
The bootkit payload is packaged as a standard UEFI DXE driver. It is introduced into the system either via simulated capsule updates or direct SPI flash modifications (strictly inside the hypervisor). 
* **Target:** Hooking the `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` table.
* **Mechanism:** The driver locates the global `gBS` pointer and replaces function pointers such as `AllocatePool` and `CreateEvent` to track memory allocation of the legitimate OS bootloader (e.g., `bootmgfw.efi` or `GRUB`).

### 3.2 ExitBootServices Interception
To survive the transition from the UEFI environment to the OS kernel, the bootkit must intercept the hand-off.
* **Target:** `gBS->ExitBootServices`
* **Mechanism:** 
  1. The malware hooks `ExitBootServices`.
  2. When the OS bootloader calls this function to take control of memory mapping, the hook is triggered.
  3. The bootkit payload secures its own memory by marking it as `EfiRuntimeServicesCode` or `EfiRuntimeServicesData`, which the OS is legally bound to preserve.
  4. The hook attempts to patch the loaded OS kernel image in memory before returning execution to the original `ExitBootServices`.

### 3.3 Model Specific Register (MSR) Hooking
To emulate advanced stealth characteristics (e.g., hiding from EDRs running in Ring-0):
* **Target:** `IA32_LSTAR` or `IA32_SYSENTER_EIP` MSRs.
* **Mechanism:** The bootkit alters the system call handler routines, intercepting OS-level API calls before they reach the kernel, ensuring deep system introspection capabilities.

> **⚠️ Scope Justification:** MSR hooking extends beyond traditional bootkit persistence into rootkit-adjacent territory. This technique is included because real-world adversaries (e.g., CosmicStrand) employ it as a post-boot stealth mechanism, and the Barzakh-Scanner must be validated against it. This module is **read-only instrumentation** — it intercepts and logs system calls but does **not** modify kernel data structures, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence beyond the current boot session. This distinction keeps the implementation within the PRD's Non-Goals boundary (§3.3). If this is determined to exceed acceptable scope, the module can be disabled via the `BARZAKH_DISABLE_MSR_HOOK` build flag without affecting the core DXE/ExitBootServices emulation.

## 4. Defensive Attestation Module

This module ensures that the research acts as a "blue-team" tool, effectively logging and verifying the impact of the aforementioned hooks.

### 4.1 PCR Querying
* Utilizes the `EFI_TCG2_PROTOCOL`.
* Reads critical Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), specifically PCR 0 (Core System Firmware), PCR 2 (Option ROMs), and PCR 4 (Boot Manager Code).
* Compares expected hash values (whitelisted boot process) against the compromised values to quantify detection efficacy.

### 4.2 TCG Event Log Parsing
* Extracts the TCG Event Log from firmware memory.
* Analyzes `EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_APPLICATION` and `EV_EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_DRIVER` entries.
* Provides the ground truth data for the `Barzakh-Scanner` rule generation.

### 4.3 Telemetry & Attestation Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates how defensive telemetry flows from the UEFI environment through to the analysis pipeline, ensuring data integrity at each stage.

    end

    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style G fill:#6f9,stroke:#333
    style I fill:#69f,stroke:#333
```

**Key invariants:**
* Telemetry never traverses a network — all data transfer is via serial pipe or mounted virtual disk.
* Raw logs are hashed (SHA-256) immediately upon extraction; hashes are recorded in the CI report for tamper detection.
* Cold storage archives are retained per the PRD data retention policy (§8, max 36 months).

## 5. Security Constraints & Failsafes

### 5.1 Hardware-Rooted Binding 
To prevent the payload from running on any ad-hoc machine, the driver performs an early execution check:
1. **SMBIOS Check:** Queries the SMBIOS table for the unique System UUID.
2. **TPM EK Check:** Queries the TPM Endorsement Key public certificate.
3. If the identifiers do not cryptographically match the hardcoded values of the authorized lab equipment, the driver will issue an `EFI_ABORTED` status code and voluntarily unload itself.

### 5.2 Flash Recovery 
A fail-safe to prevent test hardware bricking:
* Employs QEMU `-pflash` snapshots allowing instantaneous rollback of the OVMF firmware state.

### 5.3 Build Chain Integrity & Reproducibility
To prevent supply-chain tampering and ensure academic reproducibility:
* **OVMF Version Pinning:** All builds must use a specific, pinned OVMF commit hash (e.g., `edk2-stable202405`, commit `a]b1c2d3e4f5`). The exact commit is recorded in `scripts/build.sh` and must match the value documented in the test environment setup.
* **Reproducible Builds:** `build.sh` uses deterministic compiler flags (`-frandom-seed`, fixed `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`) to ensure byte-identical outputs across machines.
* **Artifact Signing:** All compiled `.efi` binaries are signed with a project-specific Ed25519 key (stored in an HSM or hardware token, never committed to the repository). Signatures are verified before any QEMU test execution.
* **SBOM Generation:** Each build produces a Software Bill of Materials (SPDX format) cataloging all EDK II dependencies, compiler versions, and OVMF source hashes.
* **Commit Signing:** All repository commits must be GPG-signed. Unsigned commits are rejected by branch protection rules.

## 7. Adversary Crate Architecture

The `barzakh-adversary` crate implements a red-team payload generation and validation framework. It is exposed to end-users via the standalone `barzakh-adversary` binary (built from `barzakh-cli/src/adversary_main.rs`), which provides CLI commands: `generate`, `list`, `corpus`, `validate`, `qemu`, and `esp`.

### 7.1 Payload Trait

```rust
pub trait Payload: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn arch(&self) -> Arch;
    fn generate(&self, config: &PayloadConfig) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
    fn expected_detections(&self) -> Vec<ExpectedFinding>;
}
```

Each payload generates a raw binary blob mimicking a specific bootkit artifact. The `expected_detections()` method declares which scanner detectors should fire, enabling automated validation.

### 7.2 Payload Registry

| Payload | Binary Output | Scanner Detector Triggered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TrampolinePayload` | x86_64: `FF 25` indirect JMP; ARM64: `LDR X16 + BR X16`; RISC-V: `AUIPC + LD + JALR` | `memory` (trampoline patterns) |
| `BootServicesHookPayload` | `BOOTSERV` header + mismatched CRC32 + suspicious pointers | `hook` (CRC + pointer range) |
| `PeInjectPayload` | Minimal MZ + PE\0\0 at page-aligned offset | `memory` (PE in runtime) |
| `FirmwareVolumeTamperPayload` | `_FVH` signature with corrupted 16-bit header checksum | `firmware_volume` (checksum failure) |
| `SignaturePlantPayload` | BlackLotus, CosmicStrand, MoonBounce byte sequences | `memory` (Aho-Corasick match) |

#### Android Boot Payloads (AArch64)

| Payload | Binary Output | Scanner Detector Triggered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AndroidPkvmEscapePayload` | Forged pvmfw image with EL2 shellcode entry | `android_pkvm` |
| `AndroidDiceForgePayload` | CBOR DICE chain with predictable CDI values | `android_dice` |
| `AndroidGkiTamperPayload` | boot.img v4 with modified ramdisk + invalid AVB hash | `android_gki_boot` |
| `AndroidRkpSpoofPayload` | RKP blob with fake EEK certificate chain | `android_rkp` |
| `AndroidBtForgePayload` | Fake transparency log with crafted Merkle path | `android_binary_transparency` |
| `AndroidTrustyTamperPayload` | Trusty image with patched entry + disabled signature | `android_trusty` |
| `AndroidBootctrlPoisonPayload` | Poisoned boot_ctrl with both slots unbootable | `android_bootctrl` |
| `AndroidDlkmInjectPayload` | EROFS image with unsigned kernel module | `android_vendor_dlkm` |
| `AndroidBootconfigInjectPayload` | Boot image with malicious bootconfig section | `android_bootconfig` |

### 7.3 Validation Pipeline

```
generate() → Vec<u8> → write to temp file → BarzakhScanner::scan()
    → compare ScanResult.findings against expected_detections()
    → report: detected/missed, matched findings count, severity
```

### 7.4 Corpus Generator

`generate_corpus(output_dir)` produces paired files for each payload:
- `malicious_<name>.bin` — generated payload (triggers detections)
- `clean_<name>.bin` — zero-filled reference (no detections)

These integrate with `BarzakhScanner::validate_against_corpus()` for automated TPR/FPR measurement.

## 8. Conditional Functional Mode (AArch64)

The `ExceptionVectorHook` module supports two compilation modes:

| Mode | Build Flag | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simulation** (default) | None | Logs simulated VBAR relocation steps via DEBUG output |
| **Functional** | `-DBARZAKH_FUNCTIONAL=1` | Performs real `MRS/MSR VBAR_EL1` operations in QEMU EL1 |

In functional mode, the module:
1. Reads the current VBAR_EL1 via inline assembly
2. Allocates a page-aligned buffer via Boot Services
3. Copies the original 2KB vector table
4. Patches the Lower EL AArch64 Sync entry with a trampoline (`LDR X16; BR X16` → original handler)
5. Redirects VBAR_EL1 to the new table via `MSR + ISB`

The trampoline redirects back to the original handler — demonstrating the hook mechanism without destabilizing the system.
