# Security Policy

## Overview

The Aegis-Boot project is an academic research initiative focused on defensive security. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability disclosure procedures, and incident response protocols.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- All source code in this repository
- Build and deployment scripts
- Documentation and configuration files
- Development and testing infrastructure
- Audit and logging systems

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense-in-Depth

Multiple layers of security controls:
- Hardware-rooted kill-switches (UUID, TPM EK binding)
- Time-based expiry mechanisms
- Air-gapped execution environments
- Append-only audit logging
- Cryptographic signing of artifacts

### 2. Least Privilege

- Minimal permissions for all operations
- Role-based access control
- Separation of duties
- Regular access reviews

### 3. Transparency

- Open documentation of security mechanisms
- Public disclosure of vulnerabilities (after remediation)
- Peer-reviewed security architecture
- Reproducible builds

## Vulnerability Disclosure

## Coordinated Disclosure Process

### For Novel UEFI/Firmware Vulnerabilities

If your research with Aegis-Boot leads to the discovery of a novel vulnerability in UEFI implementations (Intel, AMD, Microsoft, etc.):

#### Phase 1: Internal Triage (Days 0-7)

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Document the finding in a classified internal report
   - Notify the Principal Investigator immediately
   - Pause all related testing activities
   - Secure all evidence and reproduction steps

2. **Internal Review**:
   - PI, Information Security Officer, and Legal Counsel assess the finding
   - Determine if it's a genuine 0-day or known issue
   - Classify severity and potential impact
   - Prepare technical advisory

#### Phase 2: Vendor Notification (Days 7-14)

1. **Prepare Advisory**:
   - Detailed technical description
   - Reproduction steps (QEMU-only)
   - Affected firmware versions
   - Suggested mitigations
   - CVE request preparation

2. **Notify Affected Parties**:
   - Vendor PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team)
   - CERT/CC (Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center)
   - Use encrypted communication channels
   - Request acknowledgment within 48 hours

3. **Vendor Contact Information**:
   - **Intel**: secure@intel.com
   - **AMD**: psirt@amd.com
   - **Microsoft**: secure@microsoft.com
   - **CERT/CC**: cert@cert.org

#### Phase 3: Embargo Period (Days 14-90)

1. **Maintain Confidentiality**:
   - No conference talks or presentations
   - No pre-prints or blog posts
   - No social media discussion
   - Limited internal discussion only

2. **Vendor Collaboration**:
   - Provide additional information as requested
   - Assist with patch development and testing
   - Review vendor advisories for accuracy
   - Coordinate disclosure timeline

3. **Prepare Public Disclosure**:
   - Draft technical write-up
   - Prepare CVE request
   - Update Aegis-Scanner detection rules
   - Document in academic paper

#### Phase 4: Public Disclosure (Day 90+)

1. **Disclosure Triggers**:
   - Vendor releases patch
   - 90 days elapsed with no vendor response
   - Vulnerability discovered independently by others
   - Active exploitation detected in the wild

2. **Disclosure Package**:
   - CVE identifier and description
   - Technical write-up with details
   - Proof-of-concept (QEMU-only)
   - Detection signatures for Aegis-Scanner
   - Credit to Aegis-Boot project

3. **Post-Disclosure**:
   - Monitor for exploitation attempts
   - Update project documentation
